# ai-virtual-volume-control
A Python project that uses hand gestures to control your system volume in real time. The system leverages OpenCV for webcam input, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and PyCaw for controlling system audio.  When you bring your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart, the system adjusts the volume accordingly â€” just like a virtual volume knob.
